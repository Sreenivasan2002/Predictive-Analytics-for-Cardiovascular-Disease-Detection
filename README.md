# Predictive-Analytics-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection

Predictive Analytics for Cardiovascular Disease Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in individuals using various health-related features. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze data and provide accurate predictions based on input features such as age, height, weight, gender, smoking habits, alcohol intake, physical activity, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels.
